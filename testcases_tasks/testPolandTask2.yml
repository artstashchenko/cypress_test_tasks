Exercise 2:
Imagine the team is working on a new chat box functionality - whether or not
the sent message has been read. The test team received a brief documentation of the new one
functionalities (user story):
- USER1 sends a message to USER2 when the message has been sent successfully
(confirmation from the server), on the USER1 side under the sent message
the label "sent" appears
- when USER2 was notified that it had received a new message from USER1
(confirmation from the server), on the USER1 side under the sent message
a new label appears - "delivered"
- when USER2 opened a conversation window with USER1 and a message was sent to him
displayed, on the USER1 side a new label appears under the sent message -
"Read"
- when USER1 is sending a message to USER2 and USER2 has a window open at this time
conversations with USER1, USER1 will not see the "read" label until it occurs
one of the following conditions:
- USER2 will interact with the conversation window (e.g. start writing a message
to USER1) - 10 seconds will elapse after the message is displayed in the USER2 window
Suggest detailed (preconditions, steps, expected results, etc.) test cases
for new functionality (user story acceptance tests).
